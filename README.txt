A service that allows Delta Sky Mile members who have earned up a good bit of Sky Mile points may not ever use them all on flights, so we created a way for them to transfer their points to fund their convenient transportation out of the airport to their next location or use it on other services like food, gifts, and much more. This would help alleviate the inconvenience of having to wait for a taxi or set-up a pickup. It also makes the journey less time consuming because as soon as you get your bag, you will be able to head to your scheduled ride.

This was our Hack GT project for the Delta challenge - Best Corporate Customer Travel Experience
